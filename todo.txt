Phase 2: Collect and normalize data

Collect

Use system libraries (e.g. psutil, /proc, etc.) to pull data.

Store metadata for each item — not just names. Example:
for a file → path, size, mtime, hash, owner, permissions.

Normalize

Normalize data formats (e.g. consistent timestamps, lowercase paths, numeric UIDs).

Filter ephemeral or irrelevant entries (temporary files, socket files, etc.).

Sort or hash lists so comparisons later are easy.

Verify trust

Only baseline when you’re certain the system is clean.

Optionally, compare your baseline files to package manager hashes (dpkg -V, rpm -V) to ensure integrity before trusting it.
